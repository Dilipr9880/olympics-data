📌 Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results.
The goal is to uncover trends, relationships, and patterns in Olympic data through statistical measures and visualizations.

EDA is both a science (using tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) and an art (asking the right questions, interpreting insights, and presenting them visually).

🎯 Objectives

Download and prepare the dataset from Kaggle.

Perform data cleaning & preprocessing with Pandas.

Explore participation trends, medal distribution, gender balance, and more.

Use visualizations to uncover hidden insights.

Summarize findings and key conclusions.

✅ Inferences & Conclusions

Olympic participation has steadily grown over time.

Female participation has significantly increased, especially in the Summer Olympics.

Some athletes have won medals even beyond 60 years of age.

A handful of countries dominate gold medal counts.

The Olympics were heavily impacted during WWI and WWII.
